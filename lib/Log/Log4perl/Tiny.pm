=head1 DESCRIPTION

Yes... yet another logging module. Nothing particularly fancy nor
original, too, but a single-module implementation of the features I
use most from L<Log::Log4perl> for quick things, namely:

=over

=item *

easy mode and stealth loggers (aka log functions C<INFO>, C<WARN>, etc.);

=item *

debug message filtering by log level;

=item *

line formatting customisation;

=item *

quick sending of messages to a log file.

=back

There are many, many things that are not included; probably the most
notable one is the ability to provide a configuration file.

=head2 Why?

I have really nothing against L<Log::Log4perl>, to the point that
one of the import options is to check whether L<Log::Log4perl> is installed
and use it if possible. I just needed to crunch the plethora of
modules down to a single-file module, so that I can embed it easily in
scripts I use in machines where I want to reduce my impact as much as
possible.

=head2 Log Levels

L<Log::Log4perl::Tiny> implements all I<standard> L<Log::Log4perl>'s
log levels, without the possibility to change them. The correspondent
values are available in the following variables (in order of increasing
severity or I<importance>):

=over

=item C<< $TRACE >>

=item C<< $DEBUG >>

=item C<< $INFO >>

=item C<< $WARN >>

=item C<< $ERROR >>

=item C<< $FATAL >>

=back

You can import these variables using the C<:levels> import facility,
or you can use the directly from the L<Log::Log4perl::Tiny> namespace.
They are imported automatically if the C<:easy> import option is specified.

=head2 Easy Mode Overview

I love L<Log::Log4perl>'s easy mode because it lets you set up a
sophisticated logging infrastructure with just a few keystrokes:

   use Log::Log4perl qw( :easy );
   Log::Log4perl->easy_init({
      file   => '>>/var/log/something.log',
      layout => '[%d] [%-5P:%-5p] %m%n',
      level  => $INFO,
   });
   INFO 'program started, yay!';

   use Data::Dumper;
   DEBUG 'Some stuff in main package', sub { Dumper(\%main::) };

If you want, you can replicate it with just a change in the first line:

   use Log::Log4perl::Tiny qw( :easy );
   Log::Log4perl->easy_init({
      file   => '>>/var/log/something.log',
      layout => '[%d] [%-5P:%-5p] %m%n',
      level  => $INFO,
   });
   INFO 'program started, yay!';

   use Data::Dumper;
   DEBUG 'Some stuff in main package', sub { Dumper(\%main::) };

Well... yes, I'm invading the L<Log::Log4perl> namespace in order to
reduce the needed changes as mush as possible. This is useful when I
begin using L<Log::Log4perl> and then realise I want to make a single
script with all modules embedded. There is also another reason why
I put C<easy_init()> in L<Log::Log4perl> namespace:

   use Log::Log4perl::Tiny qw( :full_or_fake :easy );
   Log::Log4perl->easy_init({
      file   => '>>/var/log/something.log',
      layout => '[%d] [%-5P:%-5p] %m%n',
      level  => $INFO,
   });
   INFO 'program started, yay!';

   use Data::Dumper;
   DEBUG 'Some stuff in main package', sub { Dumper(\%main::) };

With import option C<full_or_fake>, in fact, the module first tries to
load L<Log::Log4perl> in the caller's namespace with the provided
options (except C<full_or_fake>, of course), returning immediately if
it is successful; otherwise, it tries to "fake" L<Log::Log4perl> and
installs its own logging functions. In this way, if L<Log::Log4perl>
is available it will be used, but you don't have to change anything
if it isn't.

Easy mode tries to mimic what L<Log::Log4perl> does, or at least
the things that (from a purely subjective point of view) are most
useful: C<easy_init()> and I<stealth loggers>.

=head2 C<easy_init()>

L<Log::Log4perl::Tiny> only supports three options from the big
brother:

=over

=item C<< level >>

the log level threshold. Logs sent at a higher or equal priority
(i.e. at a more I<important> level, or equal) will be printed out,
the others will be ignored. The default value is C<$INFO>;

=item C<< file >>

a file name where to send the log lines. For compatibility with
L<Log::Log4perl>, a 2-arguments C<open()> will be performed, which
means you can easily set the opening mode, e.g. C<<< >>filename >>>.
The default is to send logging messages to C<STDERR>;

=item C<< layout >>

the log line layout (it can also be spelled C<format>, they are
synonims). The default value is the following:

   [%d] [%5p] %m%n

which means I<date in brackets, then log level in brackets always
using five chars, left-aligned, the log message and a newline>.

=back

If you call C<easy_init()> with a single unblessed scalar, it is
considered to be the C<level> and it will be set accordingly.
Otherwise, you have to pass a hash ref with the keys above.

=head2 Stealth Loggers

Stealth loggers are functions that emit a log message at a given
severity; they are installed when C<:easy> mode is turned on.

They are named after the corresponding level:

=over

=item C<< TRACE >>

=item C<< DEBUG >>

=item C<< INFO >>

=item C<< WARN >>

=item C<< ERROR >>

=item C<< FATAL >>

=back

Additionally, you get the following logger functions (again, these are
in line with L<Log::Log4perl>):

=over

=item C<< ALWAYS >>

emit log whatever the configured logging level;

=item C<< LOGWARN >>

emit log at C<WARN> level, C<warn()> and then exit;

=item C<< LOGDIE >>

emit log at C<FATAL> level, C<die()> and then exit (if C<die()>
didn't already exit);

=item C<< LOGEXIT >>

emit log at C<FATAL> level and then exit;

=item C<< LOGCARP >>

emit log at C<WARN> level and then call C<Carp::carp()>;

=item C<< LOGCLUCK >>

emit log at C<WARN> level and then call C<Carp::cluck()>;

=item C<< LOGCROAK >>

emit log at C<FATAL> level and then call C<Carp::croak()>;

=item C<< LOGCONFESS >>

emit log at C<FATAL> level and then call C<Carp::confess()>;

=back

If you want to set the exit code for C<LOGWARN> and C<LOGEXIT> above
(and L<LOGDIE> as well, in case C<die()> does not exit by itself),
you can go "the L<Log::Log4perl> way" and set
C<$Log::Log4perl::LOGEXIT_CODE>, or set a code with
C<logexit_code()> - but you have to wait to read something about the
object-oriented interface before doing this!

There is also one additional stealth function that L<Log::Log4perl>
misses but that I think is of the outmoste importance: L<LOGLEVEL>, to
set the log level threshold for printing. If you want to be 100%
compatible with Log::Log4perl, anyway, you should rather do the following:

   get_logger()->level(...);  # instead of LOGLEVEL(...)

=head2 Emitting Logs

To emit a log, you can call any of the stealth logger functions or any
of the corresponding log methods. All the parameters that you pass are
sent to the output stream as they are, except code references that are
first evaluated. This lets you embed costly evaluations (e.g. generate
heavy dumps of variabls) inside subroutines, and avoid the cost
of evaluation in case the log is filtered out:

   use Data::Dumper;
   LOGLEVEL($INFO); # cut DEBUG and TRACE out
   TRACE 'costly evaluation: ', sub { Dumper($heavy_object) };
   # Dumper() is not actually called because DEBUG level is
   # filtered out

If you use the C<log()> method, the first parameter is the log level,
then the others are interpreted as described above.

=head2 Log Line Layout

The log line layout sets the contents of a log line. The layout is
configured as a C<printf>-like string, with placeholder identifiers
that are modeled (with simplifications) after L<Log::Log4perl>'s ones:

    %c Category of the logging event.
    %C Fully qualified package (or class) name of the caller
    %d Current date in yyyy/MM/dd hh:mm:ss format
    %F File where the logging event occurred
    %H Hostname
    %l Fully qualified name of the calling method followed by the
       callers source the file name and line number between 
       parentheses.
    %L Line number within the file where the log statement was issued
    %m The message to be logged
    %M Method or function where the logging request was issued
    %n Newline (OS-independent)
    %p Priority of the logging event
    %P pid of the current process
    %r Number of milliseconds elapsed from program start to logging 
       event
    %% A literal percent (%) sign

Notably, both C<%x> (NDC) and C<%X> (MDC) are missing. Moreover, the
extended specifier feature with additional info in braces (like
C<%d{HH:mm}>) is missing, i.e. the structure of each specifier above
is fixed. (Thanks to C<Log::Tiny> for the cool trick of how to handle
the C<printf>-like string, which is probably mutuated from
C<Log::Log4perl> itself according to the comments).

=head1 INTERFACE 

You have two interfaces at your disposal, the functional one (with all
the stealth logger functions) and the object-oriented one (with
explicit actions upon a logger object). Choose your preferred option.

=head2 Functional Interface

The functional interface sports the following functions (imported
automatically when C<:easy> is passed as import option):

=over

=item C<< TRACE >>

=item C<< DEBUG >>

=item C<< INFO >>

=item C<< WARN >>

=item C<< ERROR >>

=item C<< FATAL >>

stealth logger functions, each emits a log at the corresponding level;

=item C<< ALWAYS >>

emit log whatever the configured logging level;

=item C<< LOGWARN >>

emit log at C<WARN> level, C<warn()> and then exit;

=item C<< LOGDIE >>

emit log at C<FATAL> level, C<die()> and then exit (if C<die()>
didn't already exit);

=item C<< LOGEXIT >>

emit log at C<FATAL> level and then exit;

=item C<< LOGCARP >>

emit log at C<WARN> level and then call C<Carp::carp()>;

=item C<< LOGCLUCK >>

emit log at C<WARN> level and then call C<Carp::cluck()>;

=item C<< LOGCROAK >>

emit log at C<FATAL> level and then call C<Carp::croak()>;

=item C<< LOGCONFESS >>

emit log at C<FATAL> level and then call C<Carp::confess()>;

=item C<< LOGLEVEL >> (not in L<Log::Log4perl>)

set the minimum log level for sending a log message to the output;

The functional interface is actually based upon actions on
a pre-defined fixed instance of a C<Log::Log4perl::Tiny> object,
so you can do the same with a logger object as well:

=over

=item C<< get_logger >>

this function gives you the pre-defined logger instance (i.e. the
same used by the stealth logger functions described above).

=item C<< new >>

if for obscure reasons the default logger isn't what you want, you
can get a brand new object!

=back

The methods you can call upon the object mimic the functional
interface, but with lowercase method names:

=over

=item C<< trace >>

=item C<< debug >>

=item C<< info >>

=item C<< warn >>

=item C<< error >>

=item C<< fatal >>

stealth logger functions, each emits a log at the corresponding level;

=item C<< always >>

emit log whatever the configured logging level;

=item C<< logwarn >>

emit log at C<WARN> level, C<warn()> and then exit;

=item C<< logdie >>

emit log at C<FATAL> level, C<die()> and then exit (if C<die()>
didn't already exit);

=item C<< logexit >>

emit log at C<FATAL> level and then exit;

=item C<< logcarp >>

emit log at C<WARN> level and then call C<Carp::carp()>;

=item C<< logcluck >>

emit log at C<WARN> level and then call C<Carp::cluck()>;

=item C<< logcroak >>

emit log at C<FATAL> level and then call C<Carp::croak()>;

=item C<< logconfess >>

emit log at C<FATAL> level and then call C<Carp::confess()>;

=back

The main logging function is actually the following:

=over

=item C<< log >>

the first parameter is the log level, the rest is the message to log

=back

Additionally, you have the following accessors:

=over

=item C<< level >>

set the minimum level for sending messages to the output stream;

=item C<< fh >>

set the output filehandle;

=item C<< format >>

=item C<< layout >>

set the line formatting;

=item C<< logexit_code >>

set the exit code to be used with C<logexit()> and C<logwarn()> (and
C<logdie()> as well if C<die()> doesn't exit).
